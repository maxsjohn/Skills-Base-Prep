# Object-Oriented Design Interview Framework - Detailed Notes

## Overview

OOD interviews are highly versatile and require a structured approach to transform abstract requirements into concrete architecture or code while showcasing thoughtful trade-offs under real-world constraints.

## Types of OOD Interviews

### Three Primary Deliverable Formats

1. **UML Diagrams**
   - Traditional standard, still commonly used
   - Visually represent system designs
   - Show relationships between classes (attributes, methods, interactions)

2. **Code Skeleton** (Most Popular)
   - More closely resembles real-world development
   - Define structure directly in code
   - Use appropriate class and method declarations
   - Leave method bodies unimplemented
   - Allows exploration of implementation details

3. **Working Code**
   - Fully functional, bug-free implementations
   - May include test cases
   - Highest fidelity to real industry development
   - Problems typically simplified for time constraints

### Key Tip
**Ask early**: "Are we focusing on high-level class diagram, code structure, or a full implementation?" This helps tailor your approach for the 45-60 minute timeframe.

## Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering (5-10 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Thoroughly analyze problem statement
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Ask targeted questions to resolve ambiguities
- Establish realistic constraints
- Confirm assumptions
- Ensure shared understanding of scope and priorities

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on most essential requirements first
- Use concrete examples to clarify scope
- Present simple and complex scenarios
- Avoid obvious/overly detailed questions
- Don't repeat previously answered questions
- Avoid irrelevant or overly complex topics

**Example Questions:**
- What types of vehicles should the parking lot support?
- Should we design different types of parking spaces for different vehicle types?

### Step 2: Identify Core Objects (3-7 minutes)

**Approach:**
- Select a primary use case
- Walk through it step-by-step
- Map nouns to objects (e.g., "parking lot," "vehicle," "ticket")
- Map verbs to methods (e.g., "assign spot," "calculate fee")
- Create naive but relevant initial design

**Key Principles:**
- Focus on 2-3 representative use cases
- Keep design focused and minimal
- Acknowledge complex topics without getting sidetracked
- Define core object responsibilities clearly

**Optional:** Use case diagrams can help visualize workflows (ask interviewer if helpful)

### Step 3: Design Class Diagram and Code (20-25 minutes)

**Two Approaches:**

1. **Top-down Approach**
   - Identify high-level components/parent classes first
   - Refine attributes and methods

2. **Bottom-up Approach**
   - Define concrete classes first (attributes, methods)
   - Build relationships from there

**Design Principles:**
- Low coupling and high cohesion
- Encapsulation, single responsibility, inheritance
- Define object interactions and assign responsibilities
- Focus on essential parts unless interviewer requests more
- Consider appropriate data structures for performance

**Implementation Tips:**
- Start with foundational components
- Sketch UML diagram to show relationships
- Write class definitions with relevant attributes/method signatures
- Explain rationale to interviewer
- Validate design as you progress

### Step 4: Deep Dive Topics (10-15 minutes, optional)

**Activities:**
- Handle edge cases
- Resolve inconsistencies
- Address follow-up questions
- Explore advanced aspects
- Make thoughtful trade-offs

**Areas to Consider:**
- Inheritance vs. composition
- Data modeling choices
- Design patterns
- Dynamic pricing strategies
- Concurrency handling

## Parking Lot Example Walkthrough

### Requirements Gathering
- Support different vehicle types (cars, motorcycles, buses)
- Bus takes up three spots
- Different parking space types
- Reserved spaces
- Accurate fee calculation

### Core Objects Identified
- **ParkingLot**: manages overall structure, tracks spaces, handles vehicle flow
- **ParkingSpot**: tracks size, availability, assigned vehicle
- **Vehicle**: base class with subclasses (Car, Motorcycle, Bus)
- **Ticket**: stores entry time, calculates fees

### Relationships
- ParkingLot contains multiple ParkingSpots (composition)
- ParkingSpot can hold one Vehicle (association)
- Ticket links Vehicle to ParkingSpot (association)

## Handling Interview Challenges

### 1. Shifting Requirements and Expanding Scope
**Response Strategy:**
- Acknowledge new requirement
- Assess impact on current design
- Explain accommodation or trade-offs needed
- Be flexible but strategic
- Recognize potential design blind spots

### 2. Being Pulled into Deep Dive Too Early
**Response Strategy:**
- Set expectations early
- Check in on time and structure
- Suggest completing broader structure first
- Circle back to detailed areas later

### 3. Struggling to Communicate Thought Process
**Response Strategy:**
- Begin with high-level system summary
- Use visuals (class diagrams, code skeletons)
- Focus on why decisions were made
- Choose intuitive names for classes/methods

### 4. Dealing with Disengaged Interviewer
**Response Strategy:**
- Ask for feedback politely
- Let work speak for itself
- Focus on delivering clean diagrams/runnable code

### 5. Design Decisions Being Challenged
**Response Strategy:**
- Stay calm and explain thought process
- Use concrete examples/real-world analogies
- Reference trade-offs (time complexity, extensibility, maintainability)
- Offer alternatives with reasoning
- Ask for clarification if unsure

### 6. Encountering Unfamiliar Terminology
**Response Strategy:**
- Ask for clarification politely
- Show partial understanding and align
- Demonstrate humility and professionalism

### 7. Struggling with Right Level of Abstraction
**Response Strategy:**
- Start with general structure, layer in details
- Ask interviewer for preferred depth level
- Stay flexible, zoom in/out based on cues

### 8. Addressing Concurrency
**Common Scenarios:**
- Multiple users accessing same resources
- Preventing double-bookings
- Race condition prevention

**Techniques:**
- Locking mechanisms
- Optimistic locking
- Language-specific synchronization
- Concurrent data structures
- Thread management (Java: Thread, Runnable, Callable, ExecutorService)

**Implementation Approach:**
- Keep explanation concise
- Simple implementation
- High-level strategy description
- Brief code snippet for race condition prevention

## Critical Success Factors

### Essential Mindset
- Journey is as important as final deliverable
- Share thoughtful insights throughout
- Demonstrate design thinking and communication skills
- Stay adaptable and focused

### Key Technical Considerations
- Time and space complexity awareness
- Appropriate data structure selection
- Performance considerations (HashSet vs TreeSet, List vs Set)
- Complex collections and nesting familiarity

### Communication Excellence
- Avoid coding in silence
- Explain rationale transparently
- Validate design progression
- Know when design is "good enough"
- Avoid over-optimization for hypotheticals

## Final Recommendations

1. **Prepare for Versatility**: No two OOD interviews are identical
2. **Practice Framework**: Master the four-step approach
3. **Focus on Fundamentals**: Strong OOP principles over complexity
4. **Communicate Clearly**: Explain reasoning, not just solutions
5. **Stay Flexible**: Adapt to interviewer preferences and unexpected challenges
6. **Balance Detail**: Right level of abstraction for time constraints
7. **Show Trade-off Thinking**: Demonstrate real-world constraint awareness
